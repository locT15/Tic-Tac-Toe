# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe can be played on a general nrRows x nrCols board where a player wins by having nrToWin of its elements consecutively in a row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal. The traditional tic-tac-toe corresponds to the case where nrRows = nrCols = nrToWin = 3.

In this project, i implemented an alpha-beta search for the general tic-tac-toe game.
